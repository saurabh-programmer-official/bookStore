Actuators bring production ready feaures to your application without actually coding those features  in 
your application.
When your application is in production, you need to check the following 
Health Check , Auduting, Metric gathering, Monitoring etc

There is no app server concept in Micro services.. There is only fat jar.
Add actuator related dependency .
Add actuator related properties in application.properties of BookPriceMS
